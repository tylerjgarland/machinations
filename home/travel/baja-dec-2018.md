**Day 5: Los Angeles to San Diego**

I woke up early and hit the La Brea Tar Pits for nostalgia. Lunch at In-N-Out, and roughly an hour of internal debate about whether or not I should visit Legoland. I decided I didn't want to deal with being a large male adult alone in a children's theme park.

I stopped in Cardiff, visited my old apartment, some of the iconic beaches and some of the surf shops.

I had dinner with the Petras', who's children were born when I was 10 and 12 living in San Diego. They don't remember who I am, and are aspiring video game developers.

I spent the night at the Embassy Suites San Diego, which was the hotel my mother's employer put us up in when we visited California to find a house when they moved her for work. The interiors were all being remodeled, so the Koi Ponds and Jungle theme were missing. It was the only place in my whole trip I found roaches.

**Day 6: San Diego to Ensenada**

I got up early, dropped my car off at a mechanic for a check up, and wandered over to a Costco to get some money changed into Pesos. I picked up a 2 gallon gas can for the section of Baja desert I was worried about.

The mechanic told me my bike had been recalled, that my rear tire had a mild leak, and my back wheel was missing a spoke. Not much I could do about that now. I filled up my gas can and headed to the border.

The border crossing was easy, I had to stop for an American authority figure who asked me where I was coming from whether I was bringing $10,000 or more in cash or checks.

I spent an hour in Tijuana trying to find the office to get my Visa (failed) and getting a Telcel SIM card so I could get data on my phone. Route 1 was cold and foggy, similar to SF weather. I spent the night at the Ensenada Backpacker hostel, where I was one of two people in the 30 person dorm. Wandering the streets for food, I had my first few solicitation for weed, coke, girls, "anything you want man". I got dinner at some seafood place and went to sleep in the cold hostel.

**Day 7: Ensenada to Camalu**

I got up around 9:00 and walked over to the Visa office to get my tourist card. Along the way a fisherman clung to me, telling me his story and asking where I had come from. He told me his experiences with motorcycles and "helped" me get my visa, which involved me paying a guy eating tacos at a desk roughly $12 and a $6 fine for not getting the visa in Tijuana.

I had a potential client call with a company in Santa Barbara, where I had to sidestep the request to call on something other than Skype, because I didn't want to give Mexican number.

Leaving Ensenada was my first experience getting gas. All of the gas stations in Mexico are government owned, and full service so you can't pump your own gas. It involved a lot of pointing and squinting, until I got the attendant to fill my tank.

At this point I was starting to learn quite a bit about Mexican roads. Though generally well maintained, there were often potholes that were extremely hazardous, as in 2-4 inches deep. In addition to that, the countries likes using speed bumps more than the most pretentious American gated community. The speed bumps are often invisible, with no warning, and no rationale. I hit speed bumps on highways, before tight turns, after tight turns, during tight turns, immediately after another speed bump, on dirt roads, etc. MY favorite speed bumps are the ones that are black, unpainted, and placed right after a sign that indicates the speed limit is increasing.

I learned to keep my speed down to about 20 miles per hour in any town, since that town probably had a half dozen unlabeled speed bumps, and hidden just behind those speed bumps would be potholes.

Just south of town I stopped at La Bufadora, a rock formation that caused incoming waves to shoot up, similar to a blowhole. There was a huge stretch of kitschy shops and stands, but because it was the off season, everything was locked up.

In one of the small towns on Route 1, a driver in a minivan swerved off the dirt onto the road in front of me, causing me to hit my brakes and my bike to slide. A bystander helped me pick up my bike and wheel it off the road. The driver in the van sped off.

The man who helped me move my bike said someone was coming who spoke English (he told me mostly through gestures). I inspected my bike, the left handlebar was bent, the light control box was shattered, the cluth was disconnected, and the gear shift lever was bent.

The man's friend showed up. He had lived for a while in Santa Barbara and San Diego, so he spoke English very well. A Policia Municipal came by, took the statement of some witnesses, and of the bar tender at the bar we were in front of who said the man had been drinking.

The cop said that I could wait for an hour for the Highway Police to show up, if I wanted to report it. It was dark, and I was unhappy. Two people helped me wheel my bike 6 blocks to the "town mechanic" which looked like a chop shop for ATVs. The mechanic was out of town for his father's funeral, his assistant tried to fix my bike but couldn't make any progress.

The man who helped me off the road explained (via translator) that God told him I was a good man and that is why he helped me. I nodded and smiled.

I bought dinner for the man who helped me off the road and his English speaking friend. I got a room in the only hotel in the town, the Hotel California. I didn't sleep much.

**Day 8: Camalu to Guerrero Negro**

I woke up early and walked over to the mechanic, who had arrived and was working on my bike. He spoke some English and explained to me what he was doing. Most of the fixes were the "Mexican solution", which was often taping things together. They pulled my handlebar into a somewhat normal position, reattached the clutch cable and ground off enough of the shift lever until I could (sort of) shift gears again. The shift lever was sharp against the top of my foot, and my riding boots are destroyed at this point.

My options were to continue on or turn around, and after some conversations with some amazing people I decided to press forward.

I hit El Rosario at lunch, where I had some lobster tacos, and stopped at the last gas station for 200 miles. I was concerned, because my motorcycle had never exceeded a range of 140 miles. I hoped that my 2 gallon tank of gas would make the difference.

I saw few cars going in either direction in the desert, but thousands of cacti and other dry climate plants. I had actual tumbleweeds blowing over the road in front of me. When I would stop for water I could find strange spiders climbing on the rocks.

About 100 miles in I was going around a turn and surprise speed bump, which was immediately followed by an arroyo (dry sandy creek bed) that had washed over the highway. My bike slid, and other then the panic of believing I would die in the desert, and the effort of picking up my 500 pound bike along on the sand, I was unharmed.

I figured it was as good at time as any to pour my extra gas can into my tank and move on.

The rest of the trip was uneventful, and I pulled into the gas station at sunset. Surprisingly my tank was still fairly full.
I moved on to Guerrero Negro where I spent the night at the Cowboy Hotel

**Day 9: Guerrero Negro to Loreto**

This was a standard travel day, until I got to Santa Rosalia. The highway moved through an industrial town, and on one of the hills common in the road, the highway both: introduced a speed bump, and switched from pavement to deep gravel. My bike bounced on the bump, and slid on the gravel. I picked up my bike, continued on, and began to think that perhaps a road bike was not the wisest choice for this adventure.

I spent the night at the Hotel Tripui, where the climate was starting to become more tropical.

**Day 10: Loreto to La Paz**

Today was going to be an easy day, short, roughly 4 hours of riding time. I had to backtrack a bit as the gas stations south of Loreto had been abandoned, but after about 30 minutes I was back on my way. Other than a few instances of herds of goats sprinting in front of my motorcycle, the ride was fairly uneventful. I had lunch at a fast food chicken place in Cd. Constitucion, the highways were miles of straight, high speed road.

Roughly 8 miles before La Paz, and with no warning, the highway ended. There were some signs that said something along the lines of "detour" and "low speed". The detour was the sand shoulder on the right of the highway. The sand was 2-6 inches deep, which meant if I tried to hit my throttle at all my bike would topple. I had to power walk my bike for the two miles of detour. When I got back to the high way, I took a break, nursed my wrecked hands and wrists, and continued on. A mile later, there was another detour, this time for 3 miles. I had sweat through my clothes, my fingernails were bleeding, and my legs were starting to give out. Trucks heading toward me were kicking up so much sand that I was invisible to the trucks coming from behind me. A dozen times a semi trailer passed within an inch of me. As I reached the end of the detour, the sun was beginning to set. I pulled onto the road, sat for a while, gathered myself, and continued down the highway. Half a mile later, another sand detour.

It was getting dark, my muscles were failing, and I had no idea how much further this would go, or how much further I was physically capable of pushing my bike in the sand. At the end of the two mile detour I sat on the side of the road and just stared at the desert around me, questioning most of my choices.

Luckily, the rest of the road to La Paz was well paved road. I stayed at the Baja Backpacker hostel, but didn't fall asleep until sunrise.

**Day 11: La Paz to Cabo San Lucas**
For tourists, the rides are nice and paved. It was a straight, uneventful shot from La Paz to Cabo San Lucas, where I stayed at the Cabo Inn Hotel.

**Day 12: Cabo**
I wrote most of this down, and wandered around town looking for a motosports company willing to ship my bike back to San Francisco.
