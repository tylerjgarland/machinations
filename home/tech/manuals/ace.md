What is an acestream?
An acestream is a stream broadcast via p2p networking, which relies on the upload of all viewers to remain stable. Generally speaking, the more viewers, the more stable the stream. This, of course, depends on each user's bandwidth.

Are they safe to use?
Apparently GERMAN users should be aware of "Abmahnungen". I don't speak German, but a quick Google search tells me it's a legal issue. Credit to /u/eats_shit_and_dies
 for the information

For other users, as with all streams found on this subreddit (and the internet in general), the moderators of this subreddit aren't your legal advisors. This guide is meant to guide users on how to view acestreams and doesn't take responsibility for the content of any acestreams the viewer then wishes to watch. If you have any legal disputes/queries please take these up with the streamer(s) themselves.

How do I use them?
To view an acestream, you'll need to download one of the following programs:

Ace Player (Windows /// Android mobile /// Android TV /// Ubuntu /// Ubuntu (easier)) NOTE: Apparently Linux Ace Player can be difficult to set up
Soda Player (Windows /// MacOS)
Kodi
Thanks to /u/psqueak
 for the Ubuntu tutorial link

Depending on which application you have chosen, follow the relevant tutorial below.

Ace Player (PC)

1) Copy the acestream content ID. For those confused, you're looking for this bit.

2) Within Ace Player, press "Media". Screenshot

3) Select "Open Ace Stream Content ID". Screenshot

4) Paste the acestream content ID into the box. Screenshot

5) Press "Play". Screenshot

Ace Player (Mobile)

1) Copy the acestream content ID. For those confused, you're looking for this bit.

2) Within the Ace Player app, press the 3 dots in the top right corner. Screenshot

For those wondering, no, you don't need to sign in. You can sign in, but I don't know why you would ever want/need to.

3) Press "Enter Content ID". Screenshot

4) Paste the acestream content ID into the box. Screenshot

5) Press "Ok".

6) You can now select which video player you wish to use. Screenshot

You can just use your phone's default "photos" app. I personally prefer MX Player, because it looks fancy and it has a cool name. (It also offers a few extra features that your default video app likely lacks). You can, of course, use VLC for Android, or whatever other compatible video player you desire.

Soda Player

1) Copy the acestream content ID. For those confused, you're looking for this bit.

2) Within Soda Player, select "Open Acestream Link". Screenshot

3) Paste the acestream content ID in the box. Screenshot

4) Press "Open". Screenshot

Kodi

Here is the repo for the Kodi add-on: GitHub

I've never used Kodi, and have no idea how to install this or how to use it. /u/jackyaz
 may be able to better answer your questions.

There is a kodi addon that will scrape this subreddit for acestream links, but I have no idea how to use Kodi, nor what the name of this extension is. I will update this section should I find this information.

Additional Information
Stability/Buffering

To help keep the stream stable, and reduce buffering, follow this guide from /u/xenys
 on how to better contribute to the acestream.

Audio Desync

If the audio seems to be out of sync with the video, you can press the "J" & "K" keys to delay the feeds until they seem correct.

Chromecast

Chromecast devices can be used together with acestreams, by pressing "Stream" instead of "Play" when using Ace Player.

Storage Consumption

Acestream will store a lot of each game you watch in its cache, in my case I had 10GB when I checked. You can easily delete this by:

Go to the 'Advanced' section and choose "Clear disk cache".
OR

Going to C://_acestream_cache_ or D://_acestream_cache_, and deleting all the "live" files. Credit to /u/James12052
 for this information
To limit this cache and avoid future issues, there's an option in the "Ace Stream" program to put a limit on cache (by default it's in dynamic mode which just uses storage as long as you have it). Credit to /u/PharaohLeo
 for the tip!

I don't have every device in the world, so I can't provide screenshots for and/or test everything. I will update this post with any extra info as I come across it
