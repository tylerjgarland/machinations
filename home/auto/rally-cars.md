## Rules
* **Purchase price:** total door to door cost of vehicle (e.g., renting a trailer, Uber rides or any other expenses incurred in getting the vehicle to your house; gas, registration and insurance excluded).
* **Repairs:** anything required to get vehicle operational and street legal is allowed, but only OEM or OEM equivalent parts can be used. (Note: for every $1 exceeded in purchase price, $2 is removed from repair budget. If total purchase price is $1200 then repair budget is reduced: $1200 - $1000 = $200 x 2 = $400 reduction or $200 total repairs allowed.  Also, for every $1 under purchase price budget, $1 is added to repair budget. If purchase price is $800, then repair budget is increased: $1000 - $800 = $200 addition or $800 total repair budget. Finally, for every $1 exceeded in repair budget, $2 is removed from modification budget.  If repairs exceed repair budget by $100, then modification budget is reduced: $100 x 2 = $200 reduction or $200 total modification budget.)
* **Modifications:** any upgrades for performance, looks, weight saving, creature comforts. This includes any non OEM parts for example a super charger not orginally fitted from factory or stiffer suspension etc.  (Note: for upgrade/performance part to be used in lieu of OEM repair, a quote for OEM part must be submitted and that amount shall be logged under repair budget, with any overage allotted to modification budget. For example, a strut needs to be replaced and OEM part is $100 but an aftermarket upgrade is available for $200.  The mod shall be considered as $100 and repair as $100.)
* **Weight saving measures:** any item may be removed from the vehicle that does not prohibit vehicle from being legally registered (may not remove any windows or doors, for example). The only caveat is that both front seats and seat belts must remain in vehicle - this is to allow for a co-pilot which may be needed to navigate some courses or to safely evacuate from a damaged vehicle in the backcountry.
* **Transmission:** only fully manual vehicles will be allowed, no automatically shifted manual transmissions (for example the VW DSG).
* **Tickets:** each participant must contribute $100 to a shared pot to offset costs of speeding tickets incurred during a rally (tickets received en route to a rally course are excluded). The winner of each rally shall receive the entire pot minus the total amount of any tickets incurred.  The pot shall not be spent by the winner until the rally association is dissolved by selling or upgrading vehicles.
* **Navigation:** Recordable GPS must be mounted for hands free operation during race.  A track with map overlay must be submitted for race to count and must include total time, total distance, max speed and average speed (any device/app allowed, US Topo Maps has a good free app that works well).
* **Communications:** CB radio should be mandatory??
* **Tires/Brakes:** excluded from repair and mod budgets, with no limit on amount spent to keep in good working order??

## Race Courses
* **Course 1** - LA West Freeway Trainer
* Route:  https://goo.gl/maps/o8c73govJp32
* Rules:
	* Course length is 31.0 miles on the loop determined by the following freeways: I-10, I-405, I-105 and I-110 (HOV and FastTrak lanes not allowed).
	* Driver may start recording at any point on the course, but must record a total distance of at least 31.0 miles for submission to count (tracks of 30.9 miles or less will be disallowed).
	* Max speed allowed at any point on the course is 75.0 mph (any track with max speed of 75.1 mph or greater will be disallowed).
	* Track times/distances will be normalized as follows: any distance over 31.0 miles will be subtracted from total track time at average speed recorded (for example, if track submission is 31.1 miles with a time of 31:06 and average overall speed of 60.0 mph, actual race time will be adjusted: 0.1 miles / 60 mph = 6 secs subtracted from recorded time or 31:00 "normalized" time.)
	* Lowest normalized time wins the course.
	* Course can be driven either direction with the same distance and rules, but clockwise and counterclockwise will be scored as separate races.

* **Course 2** - LA North Freeway Trainer
* Route: https://goo.gl/maps/wuaggDA75zj
* Rules:
	* Course length is 25.0 miles on the loop determined by the following freeways: CA-134, I-5, I-110 and US-101.
	* Course starts and ends on the freeway on/off ramps of Magnolia Blvd and the CA-170; driver must record a total distance of at least 25.0 miles for submission to count (tracks of 24.9 miles or less will be disallowed; also tracks starting or ending on the CA-170 above Magnolia Blvd will be disallowed).
	* Max speed allowed at any point on the course is 75.0 mph (any track with max speed of 75.1 mph or greater will be disallowed).
	* Track times/distances will be normalized as follows: any distance over 25.0 miles will be subtracted from total track time at average speed recorded (for example, if track submission is 25.1 miles with a time of 25:06 and average overall speed of 60.0 mph, actual race time will be adjusted: 0.1 miles / 60 mph = 6 secs subtracted from recorded time or 25:00 "normalized" time.)
	* Lowest normalized time wins the course.
	* Course can be driven either direction with the same distance and rules, but clockwise and counterclockwise will be scored as separate races.

* **Course 3** - LA North Freeway Advanced (aka "The Kite")
* Route: https://goo.gl/maps/s1fBHGpzc4F2
* Rules:
	* Course length is 45.0 miles on the loop determined by the following freeways: CA-110, I-5, CA-2, CA-134, I-5, CA-110, I-10, CA-60, I-710, I-10, I-5 and CA-110.
	* Course starts and ends on the north/south portion of CA-110 leaving Pasadena between Glenarm St and where CA-110 turns to east/west; driver must record a total distance of at least 45.0 miles for submission to count (tracks of 44.9 miles or less will be disallowed).
	* Max speed allowed at any point on the course is 75.0 mph (any track with max speed of 75.1 mph or greater will be disallowed).
	* Track times/distances will be normalized as follows: any distance over 45.0 miles will be subtracted from total track time at average speed recorded (for example, if track submission is 45.1 miles with a time of 45:06 and average overall speed of 60.0 mph, actual race time will be adjusted: 0.1 miles / 60 mph = 6 secs subtracted from recorded time or 45:00 "normalized" time.)
	* Lowest normalized time wins the course.
	* Course must be driven in the direction indicated above.
