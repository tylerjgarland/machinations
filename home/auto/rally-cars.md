## Rules
* **Purchase price:** total door to door cost of vehicle (e.g., renting a trailer, Uber rides or any other expenses incurred in getting the vehicle to your house; gas, registration and insurance excluded).
* **Repairs:** anything required to get vehicle operational and street legal is allowed, but only OEM or OEM equivalent parts can be used. (Note: for every $1 exceeded in purchase price, $2 is removed from repair budget. If total purchase price is $1200 then repair budget is reduced: $1200 - $1000 = $200 x 2 = $400 reduction or $200 total repairs allowed.  Also, for every $1 under purchase price budget, $1 is added to repair budget. If purchase price is $800, then repair budget is increased: $1000 - $800 = $200 addition or $800 total repair budget. Finally, for every $1 exceeded in repair budget, $2 is removed from modification budget.  If repairs exceed repair budget by $100, then modification budget is reduced: $100 x 2 = $200 reduction or $200 total modification budget.)
* **Modifications:** any upgrades for performance, looks, weight saving, creature comforts. This includes any non OEM parts for example a super charger not orginally fitted from factory or stiffer suspension etc.  (Note: for upgrade/performance part to be used in lieu of OEM repair, a quote for OEM part must be submitted and that amount shall be logged under repair budget, with any overage allotted to modification budget. For example, a strut needs to be replaced and OEM part is $100 but an aftermarket upgrade is available for $200.  The mod shall be considered as $100 and repair as $100.)
* **Weight saving measures:** any item may be removed from the vehicle that does not prohibit vehicle from being legally registered (may not remove any windows or doors, for example). The only caveat is that both front seats and seat belts must remain in vehicle - this is to allow for a co-pilot which may be needed to navigate some courses or to safely evacuate from a damaged vehicle in the backcountry.
* **Transmission:** only fully manual vehicles will be allowed, no automatically shifted manual transmissions (for example the VW DSG).
* **Tickets:** each participant must contribute $100 to a shared pot to offset costs of speeding tickets incurred during a rally (tickets received en route to a rally course are excluded). The winner of each rally shall receive the entire pot minus the total amount of any tickets incurred.  The pot shall not be spent by the winner until the rally association is dissolved by selling or upgrading vehicles.
* **Nav/Comm:** GPS and CB radio should be mandatory??
* **Communications:** CB radio should be mandatory??
* **Tires/Brakes:** excluded from repair and mod budgets, with no limit on amount spent to keep in good working order??
